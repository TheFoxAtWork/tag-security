# Proposals, projects, and team

In addition to the TOC driven activities of the SIG, members may propose
projects or streams of work that are in alignment with the charter of the 
group and of interest and importance to the community.

These proposals may be converted to a project with a defined set of deliverables
or a team to focus on a larger stream of work that may involve one or more
projects and activities.

## Creating, discussing and accepting proposals

Each proposal is unique and might deviate slightly from the process below. For
example, a small addition may not require completion criteria. In general, we
encourage the process below to be followed to ensure that contributions are in
line with the [mission and charter](charter.md).

### Proposal process

1. **Raise an Issue:**
[Create an issue](https://github.com/cncf/sig-security/issues/new)
that outlines the problem to be solved. If possible, include:
    * The customer impact of the problem
    * The scope of the work required

1. **Ask the group for collaboration:** Rather than immediately beginning work
on a solution, add the issue to a meeting agenda by placing the link and the POC
in the ["Planned Meeting" area of the meeting
notes](https://github.com/cncf/sig-security#meeting-times) and bring the issue up for 
discussion at the scheduled meeting, explain it, and ask if others are interested
 in collaborating. This ensures that solutions are created with multiple 
perspectives as well as verifies there is community interest in pursuing the
proposal. The outcome of this conversation will be:
    * The group agrees that this problem is appropriate scope
  Group.
    * Criteria for completion are added to the issue that include a "definition
  of done", ideally with validation by the target audience. Also note in the
  issue if it will be a time-bounded project with a defined deliverable or and 
  on-going stream.
    * At least one person is recommended or nominated as a potential lead.
    * Those interested in working on the solution comment on the issue so
      coordination may begin and set up time or expectations with others to 
    begin work.
    * A Chair or Technical Lead agrees to act as a "sponsor", which means
    they will take responsibility to ensure that progress is tracked and
    that outcomes are reported to the group or propose closing the
    issue if there is not sufficent activity to sustain the effort.

1. **Accept or close the proposal.** Accepted proposals will be assigned
to the Sponsor and the Project or Team Lead working on the effort, with members
interested in contributing noted in the issue, along with information about 
expected duration, milestones, scope, and anticipated deliverables (for
projects).  If a proposal is closed, it should note the reason and link to
discussion minutes.

### Active projects

1. **Track progress.** As long as work is ongoing, progress should be tracked
both in the Issue and reported on periodically in meetings.
    * Someone working on the project will attend weekly meetings to answer
  questions. In case of absence, ensure that github issues is updated and
  another member of the group who can attend the meeting is familiar with
  progress in case questions arise.
    * It's strongly encouraged to include a checklist in the Isssue
  that shows what has been done and what work remains and should include a
retrospective.

1. **Pull Requests.** Completed work should result in a Pull Request (PR).
At minimum, an update to one of the group documents or roadmap indicating that
the work was done. Typically projects will result in an artifact that will
contribute to the information in this repository.

1. **Discuss the work at a meeting.** If an objection to a PR is made either in
a comment of the PR or during a meeting, the person making the objection and
the person making the proposal will be given time to present their view at the
next meeting. If there are not objections, or if all concerns have been
addressed, and the Pull Request has been stable for 24 hours, a Chair will add
it to the agenda for an upcoming meeting. Ideally, members who contributed to
the project will attend that meeting to present their work or answer questions.

1. **Vote, if required.** In some cases, there's consensus to accept a
proposal, and a vote is not required. If thereâ€™s not consensus among the group,
a formal vote is required. A comment will be left on the proposal prompting
members to vote and indicating the time the vote will close. Only one member
from each company should vote. Members will vote by leaving a comment in the
Pull Request to indicate their vote for or against. Members will have a week
after the vote begins to leave their vote. Quorum is taken to be 2/3 the number
of companies who have been active in the past month (via issue comment or 
meeting attendance as recorded in the public minutes).

1. **Support the project going forward.** Some projects require sustainment and
   maintenance to ensure continued relevance for the community.  When work is 
completed, a new issue and corresponding pull request should be created and
describe the expectations, plans, and ideas for on-going work.  It should
include historical information and guidelines for contributions and maintenance
 in the README for the project artifact's folder.
